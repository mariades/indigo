# **Hyphenated Theatre and Performance**

![melting pot](../../assets/images/melting_pot.jpeg)

This course uses dramatic and performative materials to make sense of the concept of hyphenation, its historical evolution, and socio-political significance in the United States. We will analyze plays, films, dance pieces, and performance art to answer questions such as: who could/can claim the status of a hyphenated American? How does that status relate to American citizenship, immigration, and racial/ethnic identity? How can “performing the hyphen” help us clarify the status of its bearers? In this course, performance brings into view and challenges the ways in which identity dichotomies (foreign vs citizen, immigrant vs resident, first-generation vs second-generation, racial minority vs racial majority) have shaped hyphenated subjectivities in the U.S. Ultimately, the performance pieces, artists, and theorists that we engage contest monolithic conceptions of “hyphenation” and the way in which foreignness and migration have impacted understandings of citizenship and racial belonging.
