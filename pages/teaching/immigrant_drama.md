# **Contemporary American Drama: Political Theatre**

Through the reading and viewing of plays, students analyze how theatre sheds light on cultural perspectives regarding the contemporary political landscape in the United States. The course focuses on playwrights and directors of the last ten years, all of whom are female-identifying, and on stories that address five of today's most hotly debated political issues: immigration law, abortion, gun violence, native rights, and environmental racism. Students consider how theatre can advocate for social change, raise awareness about social injustices, challenge the status quo, and engage the audience in critical thinking and discussion about the world around them.
