# **Minoritarian Feminist Performance**


![eiko](../../assets/images/eiko.jpeg)


This course offers feminist, minoritarian, and comparative perspectives to the study of theatre and performance. Performance analyses proceed hand-in-hand with reading of seminal minoritarian feminist theories by authors and activists such as Audre Lorde, bell hooks, Maria Lugones, Gayatri Spivak, Chandra Talpade Mohanty, and Cherrie Moraga. We explore a variety of representation and performance techniques from the last sixty years—theatre and drama, ritual performance, modern dance, performance art, stand-up comedy, and new burlesque, among others—from geographical areas including but not limited to the United States. This course broadens students’ perspectives on what feminism is and what performance can do to advance feminist, minoritarian agendas.
